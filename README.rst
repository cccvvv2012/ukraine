ukraine
=========

``ukraine`` glues ``haibu`` and ``node-http-proxy`` adding a little helper, ``chernobyl``, that deploys into this cloud. It is probably as stable as you think it is.

Quick start
-----------

Make sure you have ``node >= 0.8.0`` `installed <https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/README.md#to-build>`_, 0.8.15 is recommended as current stable.

Install the package globally:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo npm install ukraine -g

As a server
~~~~~~~~~~~

Start it up:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ukraine

As a client
~~~~~~~~~~~

Move to a directory with the app to deploy. Deploy pointing to cloud instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ chernobyl deploy <ukraine_ip>

Config
-----------

To set the ports the proxy and haibu are supposed to be listening on, edit the ``config.json`` file.

For setting environment variables exposed through ``process.env``, set the key value pair ``env`` in your app's ``config.json`` file.

Architecture
------------

ukraine
    Spawns a ``node-http-proxy`` server that dynamically watches for changes in a routing table. It also uses a custom loader over ``haibu`` injecting a plugin called ``kgb`` that wiretap listens if a new app has been spawned. If it was, it updates the routing table.
    
    There is also a plugin called ``ductape`` in use that will cleanup any local files before attempting to spawn a new app. Otherwise, we would constantly be spawning an older version of an app.

chernobyl
    #. checks that your app's `package.json` file is in order
    #. checks that ``ukraine`` instance is up
    #. checks and stops an existing app if need be
    #. packs the new app and sends it to the cloud to deploy
