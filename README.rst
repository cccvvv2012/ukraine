ukraine
=========

``ukraine`` glues ``haibu`` and ``node-http-proxy`` adding two little helpers, ``chernobyl`` and  ``ducktape``, that deploys into this cloud. It is probably as stable as you think it is.

Quick start
-----------

Make sure you have ``node >= 0.8.0`` `installed <https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/README.md#to-build>`_, 0.8.15 is recommended as current stable.

Install the package globally:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo npm install ukraine -g

As a server
~~~~~~~~~~~

Start it up:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ukraine

.. note::
    In order to run the server in the background, I recommend you install `forever.js <https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever>`_ and start the service as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo npm install forever -g
        $ sudo forever start /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ukraine/bin/ukraine

As a client
~~~~~~~~~~~

Move to a directory with the app to deploy. Deploy pointing to cloud instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ chernobyl deploy <ukraine_ip>

Config
-----------

To set the ports the proxy and haibu are supposed to be listening on, edit the ``config.json`` file. Edit the ``proxy_host`` property there if you are calling your server another name.

For setting environment variables exposed through ``process.env``, set the key value pair ``env`` in your app's ``package.json`` file. You can also use the ``chernobyl`` app itself to pass them if you do not want to expose them in a public ``package.json`` file.

Architecture
------------

ukraine
    Spawns a ``node-http-proxy`` server that dynamically watches for changes in a routing table. All (useful) routes to ``haibu`` have been overwritten using promises.
    
    New method for posting env vars has been added.

chernobyl
    #. checks that your app's `package.json` file is in order
    #. checks that ``ukraine`` instance is up
    #. checks and stops an existing app if need be
    #. packs the new app and sends it to the cloud to deploy

Troubleshooting
---------------

Haibu is a poorly written piece of software, be aware of these facts:

#. If you intend to use the API haibu exposes, be sure to send correct parameters in the right format, otherwise you will shut down the app.
#. Your ``package.json`` start script can only include a file name, not a bash command! Haibu checks that whatever you put in there is an existing file. Even more annoyingly, the file needs to be a js file that node can call.
#. Sometimes zlib complains when streaming a package, the code here attempts to keep packing and streaming apps to deploy if it gets these errors.
#. Uploading a new version of the app would not necessarily invalidate the old version, thus we brutforce remove the previous apps.
#. When an app is deployed, it might still take a second or two for it to actually show over the proxy server.
#. Although it should be allowed, haibu only allows to kill an app by its name, not name and username so we all deploy apps into a ``chernobyl`` namespace and if you want to deploy the same app again on a different port, you need to change its ``name`` in ``config.json``.
#. Restarting the app does not work as one would expect getting the latest env variables, stopping does not either expecting an ``application`` object instead of the ``name`` it is passed from the service. When setting new environment variable, then, we take a custom approach of stopping a running instance, getting the latest hash of its package and starting it again with these settings.
